# Basic Usage #

Chat requires Sproutcore 1.5. It was developed under 1.5.0.RC.2.

You need an XMPP server. I've tested ejabberd and OpenFire, but others should work as well. The requirements are support for MUC, BOSH and SASL ANONYMOUS (they have to be enabled as well, which is usually not the case by default for the latter two).

The server the application runs on has to respond to the BOSH requests on /http-bind/. Most likely, you'll have to implement a proxy for this. If you're using sc-server for development, the possible configuration for apache is as follows:

    ProxyPass /http-bind/ http://<ip>:<port>/http-bind/
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:4020/

Insert the BOSH-server's IP at &lt;ip&gt; and its corrsponding port at &lt;port&gt;. The sc-server is assumed to run locally.

Note that you can also use the built-in proxy support of sc-server, but due to handling only a single connection at a time, it is of very limited use for BOSH. The Buildfile includes the configuration required for that (altough you have to edit the IP-address of the server to proxy to).

# Mode of Operation #

Upon starting the web application, it immediately logs into the server using anonymous authentication. It then asks the user for a chat nick and a MUC room name. After receiving these, it logs into the chatroom and provides a very basic chatting experience.

You can enter text into the text field at the bottom, and pressing return. When pressing shift-return or using the prefix "/me ", actions (as in "bla does something" text lines) are sent instead.
